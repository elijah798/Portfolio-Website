            | Hello, I'm an aspiring Software Engineer. My life has been computers since as long as I can remember. When I was younger I woke up and fiddled with computers. It led me to building my first computer when I was 12. It was an Addiction that I couldnt get rid of. It led me further down the rabbit hole to programming. I've been programming since I was about 13 mainly writing in C++ and Python. My Dream is to work on websites that everyone uses and find helpful and pleasing to the eye.
